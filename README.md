# angular dart rx block

## focus
- app scaffold
- bloc design guidelines
- bloc implementations
- streams / sinks
- stream builders
- stream controllers
- flutter code sharing

## bloc design guidelines
- inputs / outputs are simple streams / sinks
- dependencies must be injectable
- dependencies must be platform agnostic (works on angular & flutter)
