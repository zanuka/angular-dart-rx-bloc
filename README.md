# AngularDart RX BLoC

**Objective** Create an AngularDart/Flutter app starter/scaffold that adheres to the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design guidelines, uses Reactive Programming, and promotes code sharing.

## Approach
- bloc design guidelines
- bloc implementations
- streams / sinks
- stream builders
- stream controllers
- flutter code sharing

## BLoC Design Pattern guidelines
- inputs / outputs are simple streams / sinks
- dependencies must be injectable
- dependencies must be platform agnostic (works on angular & flutter)
- no platform branching allowed (no "if flutter" or "if angular")
